## About GitFig

GitFig enables bi-directional sync between Figma and GitHub:

- **Design Sync Mode** — Sync design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) between JSON files in GitHub and Figma Variables
- **Make Bridge Mode** — Sync Figma Make's auto-created repos to your own target repositories

Version your design system with Git workflows: branches, pull requests, and full history.
